Resource Management: Handle resource allocation to avoid conflicts and optimize utilization.
Scheduling: Execute jobs based on their priority and available resources.
PrettyTable Integration: Display job details in a structured table format.

Troubleshooting
ImportError: If you face an import error, ensure the file names and imports are consistent.
